## Introduction:
R U S H is a web project designed to showcase a captivating short film called "Rush" and create an immersive experience for viewers. The project's overall concept and theme revolve around the chaos and excitement of campus life, where every second counts in the race to make it to class on time. The main goal is to provide visitors with a sense of urgency and engagement, mirroring the challenges and thrills of college life.

## Project Goals and Expectations:
The primary objectives of the project were as follows:
- **A Captivating Landing Page**: Created with the aim of building an engaging web page that immediately captures the visitor's attention through a combination of visuals and text.
- **The Short Film, "Rush"**: Highlighted as the core of the project, with the intention of making it the focal point of the website, encouraging visitors to watch it.
- **Additional Information**: Intended to be provided alongside the film, including an exploration of the film's story and insights into the importance of time management in college life.
- **The Cast members**: Aimed to be introduced to establish a personal connection, allowing viewers to learn more about them.
- **Interaction**: Intended to be facilitated with the audience by creating a "Get In Touch" section, inviting them to share their thoughts and feedback.

## Implementation Process: 
### Landing Page (Home):

### Watch Section:

- The video container maintains a responsive aspect ratio for optimal viewing.

### Meet the Cast:
